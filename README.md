# Ecological EMTO 

The ecological EMTO aims to find the most ecological way to produce a work-piece which is to say that producing impact on environment is the lowest between proposed processes.

The base of EEMTO was Efficiency Multiscale Topology Optimisation (EMTO) by E.Duriez.  You can find initial code here: https://github.com/mid2SUPAERO/EMTO.

EEMTO is also based on the code Code Pando MultiStart that affords to find the lowest compliance based on different initial designs of structure. However, this code also affords to chose just one initiale design. In the majourity of calculation that we did we used just one initiale design with a view to not take up a lot of computer memory.

# Data base EEMTO 

EEMTO needs to have a material database that has been created using soft "Ansys EduPACK", extensions "Level 3". This database is created in Microsoft Excel. This is a good platform to work in differents programms (e.g. MatLab or others). 

In this data base there are information about CO2 footprint (production, recycling), heat energy (for polymers), energy consumtion for couple "material+fabrication process" Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, density.
